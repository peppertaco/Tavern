            <h2>Group reply order strategies</h2>
            <p>
                Decides how characters in group chats are drafted for their replies.
            </p>
            <h3>Natural order</h3>
            <p>
                Tries to simulate the flow of a real human conversation. The algorithm is as follows:
            </p>
            <h4>1. Mentions of the group member names are extracted from the last message in chat.</h4>
            <p>
                Only whole words are recognized as mentions!
                If your character's name is "Misaka Mikoto", they will reply only activate on "Misaka" or "Mikoto", but
                never to "Misa", "Railgun", etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless "Allow bot responses to self" setting is enabled, characters won't reply to mentions of their
                name in their own message!
            </p>
            <h4>2. Characters are activated by the "Talkativeness" factor.</h4>
            <p>
                Talkativeness defines how often the character speaks if they were not mentioned. Adjust this value on
                "Advanced definitions" screen in character editor. Slider values are on a linear scale from
                <b>0% / Shy</b> (character never talks unless mentioned) to <b>100% / Chatty</b> (character always replies).
                Default value for new characters is 50% chance.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Random character is selected.</h4>
            <p>
                If no characters were activated at previous steps, one speaker is selected randomly, ignoring all other
                conditions.
            </p>
            <h3>List order</h3>
            <p>
                Characters are drafted based on the order they are presented in group members list. No other rules
                apply.
            </p>
            <h3>Important!</h3>
            <br>
            <strong style="color: salmon">
                Regeneration in group chats deletes all character message up until the <i>last message sent by you</i>.
                Use swipes to generate just the latest message.
