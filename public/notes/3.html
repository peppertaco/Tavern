                <p>
					The First Message is an important thing that sets exactly how and in what style the character will communicate.<Br><br> 
                    It is desirable that the character's first message be long, so that later it would be less likely that the character would respond in with very short messages. <br><br>
					You can also use asterisks ** to describe the character's actions. 
				</P>
					
					For example:
					<br><br>
                    <code>
					*I noticed you came inside, I walked up and stood right in front of you* Wellcome. I'm glad to see you here. 
					*i said with toothy smug sunny smile looking you straight in the eye* What brings you...
					</code> 
                <Br>
                <hr>
				<p>
					A list of tags that are replaced when sending to generate:<br><br>
					{{user}} and &lt;USER&gt; are replaced by User Name<br>
					{{char}} and &lt;BOT&gt; are replaced by Character Name<br><br>
