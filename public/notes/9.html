                <h2>Anchors</h2>
				<p>
                Anchors are used to increase the length of messages.<br> 
				There are two types of anchors: <u>Character Anchor</u> and <u>Style Anchor</u>
				</p>
                <p>
					<u>Character Anchor</u> - affects the character played by the AI by motivating him to write longer messages.<br><br>
					Looks like: 
					<code>[(Bot's name) talks a lot with descriptions]</code>
				</p>
                <p>
					<u>Style Anchor</u> - affects the entire AI model, motivating the AI to write longer messages even when it is not acting as the character.<Br><br>					
					Looks like:
					<code>[Writing style: very long messages]</code>
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Anchors Order sets the location of anchors in the promt, the first anchor in the order is much further back in the context and thus has less influence than second.
				</p>
                <p>
					The second anchor is only turned on after 8-12 messages, because when the chat still only has a few message the first anchor creates enough effect ob its own. 
				</p>
                <p>
					Sometimes an AI model may not perceive anchors correctly or the AI model already generates sufficiently long messages.<br>
					For these cases, you can disable the anchors by unchecking their respective boxes.
				</p>
                <p>
					<u>When using Pygmalion models these anchors are automatically disabled, since Pygmalion already generates long enough messages.</u>
