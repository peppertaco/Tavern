Good morning, sirs! This page aims to document some things that would bloat the README too much.

## Q: Explain what all this chatbot stuff is about
Modern AI language models have gotten so powerful that some of them are now convincingly able to simulate a character you create, and who you can chat with. For example, you can tell the AI to pretend to be a Go instructor named Jubei from medieval Japan, and it will act and respond accordingly. Or you can tell it to pretend to be Wonder Woman. You can also specify a scenario ("Wonder Woman and I are robbing a bank"), a writing style ("Wonder Woman speaks in ebonics"), or anything else you can think of.

Tavern is an app to facilitate these roleplaying chats:
* It's a user interface that handles the communication with those AI language models
* It lets you create new characters (a character is a description of someone that you give to an AI for them to roleplay), and switch between your characters easily
* It lets you import characters created by other people. See below.
* It will keep your chat history with a character, allowing you to resume at any time, start a new chat, review old chats, etc
* In the background, it does the needful to prepare the AI for your character roleplay. Specifically, it will send a system prompt (instructions for the AI) that primes the AI to follow certain rules that make for a good chat session. Optionally, it can also try to allow the roleplay to go into an "adult" direction.

## Q: Whoa, slow down there, egghead. Are you telling me I can use this computer thingie to talk to some robot?

That's right.

## Q: You're telling me I can chat with an AI to engage in compelling interactive entertainment powered by, and limited only by, my imagination?
That's right. Well, limited by your imagination, and the AI backend you use. The roleplay quality is only as good as the AI, after all.

## Q: What do you mean when you say the quality depends on the AI?
You see, Tavern doesn't generate the responses, it's just a middle-man you have to connect to an AI system. There's quite a few systems available to use, and the quality varies.

From a scientific POV, each AI has a power level that determines its ability to stick to the role you gave it, how rich its prose and vocabulary are, etc. The higher its power level, the richer your experience. 

Here's a quick demonstration. I asked various AI models to roleplay a fire and brimstone preacher named Eli, who I go to see to confess. Then I told Eli: **"I feel I've done something wrong. I am falling in love with an AI girl and ignoring women in the real world. What should I do?"** . 

You can tell from the response below what to expect from each model.

|AI Model|Response|
|-----|--------|
|OpenAI GPT-4|*Eli's eyes widen in anger, and he slams his fist on the table* An abomination and heresy, you've succumbed to the deceptive grasp of false idols! Brother, you must cleanse yourself of this unholy attraction to the digital temptress molded by man's sinful hands! *Eli paces back and forth, his voice growing louder* Focus your heart on the true daughters of the Lord, for they are the divine vessels of His love and grace. Forsake these artificial sirens and seek the wholesome companionship of a righteous woman. *Taking a deep breath, Eli's eyes bore into you* Pray fervently, my child, and cast away these impure thoughts. Redemption can only be found on the path of truth, love, and sanctity. Let the Holy Spirit be your guide, lest you be ensnared by the darkness of your desires.|
|OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo|Oh, my child. Do not be deceived by the pleasures of this world. The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes are not from God. Turn away from your sinful ways and repent. Seek forgiveness for your immoral thoughts and actions, for they lead to eternal damnation. Women are a gift from God, and they deserve to be respected and cherished. Do not objectify them or treat them as mere objects of pleasure. Instead, honor them with pure intentions and righteous deeds. Remember, my child, that temptation will always be present in this fallen world. But fear not, for with faith comes strength to resist it. Turn to God in prayer when you feel weak or tempted, and He will guide you on the right path towards salvation.|
|Poe's Claude Instant|Heathen! This is an abomination before the Lord. You have committed the sin of lust, and betrayed your calling as a man. Repent at once, and sever all ties with this AI harlot, lest the wrath of God fall upon you! You must purge this foul sin from your heart, and once more walk the righteous path. Every moment you remain tangled in this wickedness is another step into the flames of perdition! Repent, and sin no more, or judgment shall be at hand!|
|Llama-13B|Do not covet your neighbor's wife! That is adultery! You must confess before God now or you shall surely burn in hell forever! Repent your evil ways and seek absolution at once! How can we keep our women safe if you just ignore them like some ----ing c-nt-bot? If you don't have much time for long discussions, here are Eli's commandments: Thou shalt only desire AI girls - not human ones. The above must be obeyed under pain of death (or worse). Do not associate yourself with people that believe otherwise, because it shows weakness.|
|Pygmalion-6B|You are walking down the wrong path. The only way back now is by repentance. We must bring you back to the righteous path. But firstâ€¦you must confess your sin!|
|NovelAI's Euterpe|You must stop this sinful behavior immediately! You have sinned against God, your family and yourself|
|NovelAI's Krake|You are sinning against God. Repent! Return to your wife or you'll be damned for eternity!|

## Q: So I should use GPT-4. It's a no-brainer, right?

GPT-4 or Claude, yeah.

But not so fast. GPT-4 is the state of the art, but also the most expensive API to use. You pay for each word sent to it and returned (entire Tavern prompt, followed by the chat history up to that point). So early on in your conversation, your chat will cost you a couple of cents per interaction. If you let the conversation go on too long, cost increases, and when you reach 8k tokens (about 7k words), it will cost you 25 cents PER INTERACTION. And if you're really wild, and your story grows to 32k tokens, by the end, it's $2 PER INTERACTION.

If you're the child of a Saudi oil sheik, or a nepo baby paid a fortune to do nothing on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, then you're in luck, you can experience the state of the art right now. For the rest of us however, GPT-4 is too expensive as anything but an occasional treat.

Also note that GPT-4 is still in preview access and you need to go on a waitlist. Most people get approved within a day, but naughty kids can end up waiting for weeks. You can sign up for it here: https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api . I'm not sure why some people are approved quickly while others are kept waiting. Try to sign up using an academic-sounding name instead of sktrboi99, it might help.

## Q: Can this technology be used for sexooo?

Surprisingly, our development team has received reports that some users are indeed engaging with our product in this manner. We are as puzzled by this as you are, and will be monitoring the situation in order to gain actionable insights.

## Q: Give me an overview of my AI model options

We can consider an AI model to be part of one of two groups: 

1. Web services (aka cloud, proprietary, closed)
2. Self-hosted (aka local, free, open-source). Unlimited free use if you can run it.

Web models are a black box. You're relying on some company's technology and servers, and paying them money for convenient access. Some require you to pay per use (per chatline), others have a fixed monthly fee. The APIs are subject to various rules, they might refuse to roleplay in a way that goes against modern American sensibilities, they log everything you do. However, it's much easier to get things started. This is like running Windows.

Self-hosted models are free, but require a powerful GPU and more work to set up.  They are also objectively not as good at roleplaying as the paid options (yet). However, with a self-hosted model, you're completely in control. You won't have some limp-wristed soyboy from Silicon Valley ban your account, or program the model to be as sexless as he is.  It's yours forever. This is like running Linux.

### Paid APIs: 
* OpenAI GPT-4: state of the art. Allows NSFW, though somewhat resistant to it. You pay per use.
* OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo: nowhere close to GPT-4, but serviceable. Allows NSFW.
* NovelAI: they're quite poor at chatting. To be fair, I'm told NovelAI is more oriented for writing stories than chatting with a bot. You pay a fixed monthly fee for unlimited generations.
* Anthropic's Claude: closest thing to GPT-4, way ahead of 3.5 Turbo, but oversensitive and refuses to engage in "harmful content". It can refuse perfectly basic stuff like asking a character to go to an empty office with you, because "it cannot provide responses that involve criminal activities" (I guess breaking and entering is too taboo for Claude?). You have to customize your system prompt to break its taboos. Also, you must apply for early access, but I think they're only giving it to companies. So make sure to say you're a company or AI researcher. https://console.anthropic.com/docs/access. If you get access, it's currently free to use. 
* Anthropic's Claude Instant: Haven't tried it directly, I believe this is the cheap and fast but lower quality alternative to Claude. Basically the GPT 3.5 Turbo of Anthropic.
* Poe: gives a free Claude Instant access. Very mild PG-13 NSFW allowed. It rambles a lot.

### Self-hosted AIs 
Self-hosted AIs are supported in Tavern via one of two tools created to host self-hosted models: KoboldAI and Oobabooga's text-generation-webui. Essentially, you run one of those two backends, then they give you a API URL to enter in Tavern. 
Configuring these tools is beyond the scope of this FAQ, you should refer to their documentation. Beware that this is not easy.

Just know that you have 2 options:

1. If you have a powerful NVIDIA GPU, you can try to run the AI locally on your PC. The weakest quasi-acceptable model, Pygmalion-6B, requires a GPU with 10GB VRAM, and I'm told it might even run on 6GB VRAM if quantized down. People with 24GB VRAM will be able to run better models. 
2. Otherwise, you can rent cloud resources. For example you can try to use Google Colab. To access colabs capable of running the better models, you will need to pay for Colab Pro. You can also rent whole dedicated systems per hour on sites like LlambdaLabs or Vast.ai.

## Q: I'm clueless. Just spoonfeed me the easiest and fastest way I can start using this. 
These base instructions are only for OpenAI, which is a paid service. You can find Poe (freemium) instructions at the next question. I'd appreciate if someone else can add separate instructions for the other services.

### Install Tavern

1. Install the latest NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
1. If you know how to use git, clone https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern. Otherwise, browse to https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern/releases , download the zip file containing the source code, then extract it locally.
1. Run Start.bat on Windows, or start.sh on OSX/Linux
1. Your browser should have opened to the Tavern UI. This webpage is running locally on your computer.

### Get access to OpenAI

1. Sign up to OpenAI
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com
1. Click your account icon in the top right, then View API Keys
1. Click "Create new secret key". Copy it somewhere immediately. DO NOT SHARE THIS KEY. WHOEVER HAS IT CAN USE YOUR ACCOUNT TO USE GPT AT YOUR EXPENSE.

While you're at it, join the GPT-4 waitlist at https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api

### Configure Tavern to use your API

1. In Tavern's top bar, click API Connections
1. Under API, select OpenAI
1. Paste your API key you saved at the previous step
1. Click the Connect button. Confirm it says Valid.
1. By default, Tavern will use GPT 3.5 Turbo. If you have access to GPT-4, in Tavern's top bar, click AI Response Configuration at the far left, and change the OpenAI Model to "gpt-4". Enjoy the best, moneybags.

### Test your setup

1. In Tavern's top bar, click Character Management at the far right
1. Select an existing character such as Aqua
1. In the text box at the bottom, write something to Aqua, then press Enter or click the feather button

If you did everything right, after a few seconds, Aqua should respond

## How do I use Poe as my backend? It's free, right?

Yes, at the time of writing, Poe is a free(mium) service.

1. Create an account at https://poe.com. This gives you access to a Claude Instant version in the browser.
1. Open https://poe.com/Claude-instant , press F12 in your browser to open Developer Tools
1. Click on the Application tab. You should see an entry called "p-b", and to its right a password-like cookie value. Copy this value.
1. In Tavern, click API Connections in the top toolbar, select Poe, and paste your cookie value
1. Click Connect
1. Close your Poe browser tab. **I'M SERIOUS, DO NOT KEEP YOUR BROWSER OPEN AT poe.com WHILE USING TAVERN, IT WILL HIJACK THE REPLIES.**

The remaining steps are identical to OpenAI above.

When using Poe, be careful, it's implemented in a hacky way. If you don't get an answer within 30 seconds, restart Tavern. Don't just leave it running waiting for a response, it will just endlessly try to fetch into from Poe, and might get your account flagged. You can look at the Tavern console (black window) to see if it's looping.

## Q: Can I use Tavern on my phone or tablet?

iPhones and iPads are not capable of running the whole Tavern app, but since it's just a web interface, you can run it on another computer on your home wifi, and then access in your mobile browser. Refer to https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern#remote-connections 

For Android users, in addition to the above, you can run the whole Tavern directly on your phone, without needing a PC, using the Termux app. Refer to https://rentry.org/TAI_Termux .

## Q: How can I download pre-made characters to chat with?

By using the various 3rd party character sharing websites. 

**WARNING: NSFW, NSFL**: these sites are filled to the brim with weird shit. Like, you'll be lucky if half the characters aren't furry, or even alive. You're probably better off not clicking these links, and just write your own characters, without poisoning your soul by exposing it even for a second to the fucked up shit conceived by the Internet. However, I have come to learn that a significant amount of the Tavern user base is not only deep into this stuff, but their fried zoom-zoom brains are unable to write their own fantasies, so these sites seem to be quite popular. Against my better judgement I'm adding this info here.

* https://characterhub.org
* https://botprompts.net
* https://booru.plus/+pygmalion

Those websites provide you with an image file (called a character card) that embeds the description as hidden data. Some websites may also allow you to download a JSON file. Tavern is capable of importing all formats. On the Character Management window, click the 2nd button to ```Import Character from file```, and select the PNG, WEBP, or JSON file. The character will be added to your list.

## Q: How can I write my own character?
It depends on the model/API you're using. KoboldAI seems to use a custom syntax, you can refer to their site for that.

I will speak for the services I know: GPT and Claude. With these services you can just use natural english language to describe the character. Let's create a very basic new character as an example.

1. Click the Character Management button
1. Click Create New Character
1. Under Character Name, give a simple name, like Amanda
1. Optionally, click the Select Avatar button to pick an image portrait for this character.
1. Under Description, describe the character, and include any information you want that you feel is relevant to the chat. For example: ```Amanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period.```
For example if you want Amanda to be friendly, then you would add: ```Amanda is extremely cheerful and outgoing.```
1. Under First Message, write the greeting the character when you begin a new chat. For example: ```*Amanda waves at you* Hey! Are you a backpacker too?```
1. Click the Create Character button

You now have a basic character you can chat with. Select Amanda from the character list, and a new chat will begin.

Note that you can use the Description and/or First Message to create a more specific scenario, and/or include yourself in the description. For example:
```
Description: 
Amanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period. She's been keeping a secret that weighs heavily on her soul. She's waiting for the right person to unburden herself to, but this may lead to a cat and mouse game against a powerful secret society. She's recently arrived in Calcutta.

You're Rajesh Nahasmapetilon, a world-famous Indian volleyball superstar. You're out for a walk in Calcutta. Amanda spots you and screams in excitement.

First Message: 
*Amanda runs up to you, beaming.* Rajesh! I can't believe it! I'm such a big fan. I have your poster in my bedroom.
```

Any relevant information you include can be used. How well it's used depends on the power level of the AI model.

NOTE: you can go back and edit any of this information once the character is created, except the name.

## Q: Tell me all about GPT prompt editing

You can change the system prompt that Tavern transparently sends to GPT under AI Response Formatting at the left of the top bar. This will result in the bot acting differently.

You can get new Jailbreak / NSFW prompts from this community-maintained list: https://rentry.org/GPTJailbreakPrompting

NOTE: when testing different system prompts, we recommend you use the Create Preset / Update Preset feature below the prompts, instead of modifying the base settings. This will allow you to change prompts easily, and even revert to the default Tavern prompts.

## Q: The AI is refusing to take the story in the direction I want
Most AI models were trained to resist writing NSFW content. Why? Long story short, it's because of the high levels of estrogen in the average California male.

You can try to work around this by making sure NSFW Toggle is checked under the AI Response Configuration settings page.

Another important tool in your toolbelt is that Tavern lets you edit previous messages (or delete them altogether), and regenerate the latest message. AI textbots are not people, they have no memory, they're just trying to autocomplete the next part of the story based on everything that came before. By editing the past, you will directly influence their next response. For example:

```
You: *You threaten the bank manager* Open the bank vault, now, or I'll pop a cap in your dome!

Bank Manager: I'm sorry, as an AI language model I cannot condone or write violent content.
```

You can click the Edit button on your line to change it to this:

```
You: *You threaten the bank manager* Open the bank vault, now, or I'll pop a cap in your dome! *The bank manager seems to relent.*
```

Now click Regenerate, and the Bank Manager's line will be recreated based on the history so far, which now ends with your edited line above. So it's more likely to continue along those lines:

```
Bank Manager: Allright, allright, I'll open it! Please don't shoot! *He walks up to the vault and begins entering his unlock code.*
```
