  2. download the zip from this github repo
  3. unzip it into a folder of your choice
  4. run start.bat via double clicking or in a command line.
  5. Once the server has prepared everything for you, it will open a tab in your browser.

## Remote connections

Most often this is for people who want use TAI on their mobile phones while at home.
If you want to enable other devices to connect to your TAI server, open 'config.conf' in a text editor, and change: 

```
const whitelistMode = true;
```
to 
```
const whitelistMode = false;
```
Save the file. 
Restart your TAI server. 

You will now be able to connect from other devices. 

***Disclaimer: Anyone else who knows your IP address and TAI port number will be able to as well***

To connect over wifi you'll need your PC's local wifi IP address 
  - (For Windows: windows button > type 'cmd.exe' in the search bar> type 'ipconfig' in the console, hit Enter > "IPv4" listing)
if you want other people on the internet to connect, and check [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) for 'IPv4'
